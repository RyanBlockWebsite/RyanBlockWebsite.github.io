			<p><b>This middle picture is a recent photo of my family and I from winter break 2017-2018.  We rented a house on the small island of North Captiva, and we could not have asked for a more perfect vacation.  My sister Emily is the one sitting, my mother Sandy is in the middle next to me and my father David, standing to her right.  We all love getting to spend quality family time together and all enjoy the outdoors!  To the right and left below are other photos of the amazing times we have together.</b></p>

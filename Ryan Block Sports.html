				<b>Throughout my life I have always been shorter, but very quick and athletic.  I enjoy playing all sports on a competitive level, but also just pick-up<br> with my friends I find is one of my favorite activities.  However, throughout my life I've always really enjoyed soccer, and skiing.</b>

			I grew up skiing at a mountain called Mad River Glen in Vermont.
			<span style="float:right;">Soccer is another sport I have loved and enjoyed from a young age.  I use my speed<br> and hand eye coordination to gain anadvantage and usually play striker,however<br>  I can play just about any position well including goalie.  It is also a sport I am able<br> to enjoy with my friends, my senior year of high school my friends and I made an<br> indoor soccer team which I was the captain of and we ended up winning the<br> championship!</span>  
			It is a skiers only<br> mountain, meaning no snowboarders are allowed and it has a reputation of being one<br> of the toughest mountains in the east.  I was able to quickly teach myself by going down<br> harder trails than I should be going down, but I love the adrenaline, and love the feeling<br> of shredding through the snow on a sunny winter day more than anything.<br>

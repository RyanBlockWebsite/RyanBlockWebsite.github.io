			<p><b>	I first became officially employed when I was a sophmore at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High school, working for a<br>company called Brines Sporting goods.  Brines is the oldest family owned sporting goods store in the country, and I<br> would manage tasks from, working with customers on anything they may need sports related, to taking inventory, and <br> helping organize the thousands of jersey orders that we place for youth leagues in the surrounding towns.  I worked<br> there essentially my whole high school career, and made some very great friends and co-workers along the way</p>

			<p style="float: right;">Datto is a backup and recovery solution for businesses and focuses on business continuity, meaning it's our<br> job in the case of an emergency, to get our clients (mostly MSP's), up and running with as little downtime and<br> data loss as possible.  I actually work under a company that was purchased by Datto called Backupify, which <br>focuses on the same aspects of continuity, but in the cloud, backing up Google Apps and Office 365 data.

			<div style="float: right;"> During the summer after my freshman year of college, I began looking internships to further my professional<br> career.  I was previously a computer science major, and found a home at Datto, working<br> as a Quality Assurance Intern, testing the products, and looking for any bugs before in the software<br> to catch them before they go live.</div></b></p>

			<p><b>During my sophmore year, I switched my major from computer science to business, and leading up to the following summer, a sales position opened up for the same company, Datto.  I applied, and because of my previous experience there and my work ethic, they took me on.  Working in the sales department was a completely new experience for me, and I loved every minute of it.  I was even able to make some sales to clients and make the company some real money!  I am planning on going back this upcoming summer and hopefully transitioning into a full time job after school.</p></b>
